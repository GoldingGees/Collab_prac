    <h3>Welcome to my first website</h3>
        <p id="first">This is where it all begins in my journey to becoming a Junior Web Developer.
            My name is Golder Otobotekere. I started the Junior Web Developer training wtih Generations USA on 
            July 20, 2022.</p>
        <p id="second">Learning to code could seem very difficult at the beginning, 
        but it gets easier as you go and you begin to wonder how you got to understand it
         judging from where you started from and then you discover that just about anything can be learned 
         if you have the right tutors, learning environment, tools and more importantly, if you set your mind to do it.</p>
        <p>Below is a table of how my work daily schedule looked like when I started. You would begin to imagine 
        how I made it to the end.</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th></th>
                <th>Monday</th>
                <th colspan="2">Tuesday</th>
                <th>Wednesday</th>
                <th>Thursday</th>
                <th>Friday</th>
                <th>Saturday</th>
                <th>Sunday</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <th></th>
                <td>6:00am - 7:00pm</td>
                <td colspan="2">6:00am - 10:00am
                    7:00pm - 7:00am
                </td>
                <td>7:00pm - 7:00am</td>
                <td>10:00am - 7:00pm</td>
                <td>6:00am - 7:00pm</td>
